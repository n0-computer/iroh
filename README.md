## What is iroh?

Iroh gives you an API for dialing by public key.
You say “connect to that phone”, iroh will find & maintain the fastest connection for you, regardless of where it is.

### Hole-punching

The fastest route is a direct connection, so if necessary, iroh tries to hole-punch.
Should this fail, it can fall back to an open ecosystem of public relay servers.
To ensure these connections are as fast as possible, we [continuously measure iroh][iroh-perf].

### Built on [QUIC]

Iroh uses [Quinn] to establish [QUIC] connections between nodes.
This way you get authenticated encryption, concurrent streams with stream priorities, a datagram transport and avoid head-of-line-blocking out of the box.

## Compose Protocols

Use pre-existing protocols built on iroh instead of writing your own:
- [iroh-blobs] for [BLAKE3]-based content-addressed blob transfer scaling from kilobytes to terabytes
- [iroh-gossip] for establishing publish-subscribe overlay networks that scale, requiring only resources that your average phone can handle
- [iroh-docs] for an eventually-consistent key-value store of [iroh-blobs] blobs
- [iroh-willow] for an (in-construction) implementation of the [willow protocol]

## Getting Started

### Rust Library

It's easiest to use iroh from rust.
Install it using `cargo add iroh`, then on the connecting side:

```rs
const ALPN: &[u8] = b"iroh-example/echo/0";

let endpoint = Endpoint::builder().discovery_n0().bind().await?;

// Open a connection to the accepting node
let conn = endpoint.connect(addr, ALPN).await?;

// Open a bidirectional QUIC stream
let (mut send, mut recv) = conn.open_bi().await?;

// Send some data to be echoed
send.write_all(b"Hello, world!").await?;
send.finish()?;

// Receive the echo
let response = recv.read_to_end(1000).await?;
assert_eq!(&response, b"Hello, world!");

// Close the endpoint and all its connections
endpoint.close().await;
```

And on the accepting side:
```rs
let endpoint = Endpoint::builder().discovery_n0().bind().await?;

let router = Router::builder(endpoint)
    .accept(ALPN.to_vec(), Arc::new(Echo))
    .spawn()
    .await?;

// The protocol definition:
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct Echo;

impl ProtocolHandler for Echo {
    fn accept(self: Arc<Self>, connecting: Connecting) -> BoxedFuture<Result<()>> {
        Box::pin(async move {
            let connection = connecting.await?;
            let (mut send, mut recv) = connection.accept_bi().await?;

            // Echo any bytes received back directly.
            let bytes_sent = tokio::io::copy(&mut recv, &mut send).await?;

            send.finish()?;
            connection.closed().await;

            Ok(())
        })
    }
}
```

The full example code with more comments can be found at [`echo.rs`][echo-rs].

Or use one of the pre-existing protocols, e.g. [iroh-blobs] or [iroh-gossip].

### Other Languages

If you want to use iroh from other languages, make sure to check out [iroh-ffi], the repository for FFI bindings.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains a workspace of crates:
- `iroh`: The core library for hole-punching & communicating with relays.
- `iroh-relay`: The relay server implementation. This is the code we run in production (and you can, too!).
- `iroh-base`: Common types like `Hash`, key types or `RelayUrl`.
- `iroh-test`: Test utilities.
- `iroh-dns-server`: DNS server implementation powering the `n0_discovery` for NodeIds, running at dns.iroh.link.
- `iroh-net-report`: Analyzes your host's networking ability & NAT.
