//! Addressing for iroh endpoints.
//!
//! This module contains some common addressing types for iroh.  An endpoint is uniquely
//! identified by the [`EndpointId`] but that does not make it addressable on the network layer.
//! For this the addition of a [`RelayUrl`] and/or direct addresses are required.
//!
//! The primary way of addressing an endpoint is by using the [`EndpointAddr`].

/// Network-level addressing information for an iroh endpoint.
///
/// This combines an endpoint's identifier with network-level addressing information of how to
/// contact the endpoint.
///
/// To establish a network connection to an endpoint both the [`EndpointId`] and one or more network
/// paths are needed.  The network paths can come from various sources:
///
/// - A [discovery] service which can provide routing information for a given [`EndpointId`].
///
/// - A [`RelayUrl`] of the endpoint's [home relay], this allows establishing the connection via
///   the Relay server and is very reliable.
///
/// - One or more *direct addresses* on which the endpoint might be reachable.  Depending on the
///   network location of both endpoints it might not be possible to establish a direct
///   connection without the help of a [Relay server].
///
/// This structure will always contain the required [`EndpointId`] and will contain an optional
/// number of network-level addressing information.  It is a generic addressing type used
/// whenever a connection to other endpoints needs to be established.
