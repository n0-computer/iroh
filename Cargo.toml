# We prefer to place all dependencies for our workspace crates here.

# crate explicitly enables the features they need.
#
# There are two execeptions to this:
# - If a crate needs a dependency with `default-features=false` the
#   default features must be disabled here.
# - If we really want to uniformely enforce a feature in all crates,
#   e.g. anyhow's backtrace feature.
