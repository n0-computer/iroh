//! The [`Connection`] wraps a `quinn::Connection`.
//!
//! The [`Connection`] is how you send data to and receive data from the remote endpoint.
//!
//! There are many transitions states between attempting to start a connection and
//! receiving a cryptographically secure connection.
//!
//! The main items in this module are:
//!
//! - [`Connection`] to create streams to talk to a remote endpoint.
//! - [`Connecting`] for operating on connections that haven't finished their handshake yet.
//! - [`Incoming`] to accept or reject an incoming connection.
//! - [`ZeroRttClientConnection`] to attempt to send 0-RTT data before the cryptographic
//!   handshake has completed.
//! - [`ZeroRttServerConnection`] to attempt to read 0-RTT or send 0.5-RTT data before the cryptographic
//!   handshake has completed.
