//! Very basic example to showcase how to write a protocol that rejects new
//! connections based on internal state. Useful when you want an endpoint to
//! stop accepting new connections for some reason only known to the node. Maybe
//! it's doing a migration, starting up, in a "maintenance mode", or serving
//! too many connections.
//!
//! ## Usage
